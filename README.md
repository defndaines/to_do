# ToDo

Simple JSON API (using RESTful principles) that helps users manage tasks.

This version represents an admin viewâ€”tasks are defined in a CSV file,
and the interface does not allow users to modify or add tasks.

## Development

This project is written in Elixir. In order to build and run it, you will need
to install [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html). On Mac OS X, if you
have homebrew installed, this can be done with:
```
brew install elixir
```

### To Run Tests

Run tests from the root directory with:
```
mix test
```

### Running Locally

TBD

### GET `/users/<user-id>/tasks/<date>`
